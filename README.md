English-language slidedeck and code files for lab 4 in AL Basics of Programming class.

# Instructions for class

Download all files in this repository and upload them to a CodeBlocks project. Write and complete functions in `lab04.c`. 

If you would like to run these files in a Unix environment outside of CodeBlocks, you can run `make lab04` in the command line. This will compile and execute your program for you. You will need to ensure that `make` and `gcc` are both installed in your environment.
